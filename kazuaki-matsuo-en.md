# Tasting tests at Cookpad
@Kazu_cocoa

Hello everyone.
I'm Kazu.
Now, I'm so happy and exciting to be able to talk for many Swift and iOS develpers.

Today's my topic is associated with "TEST" since I'm test engineer at Cookpad.
"Tasting" used in my title means taste food stuff because my company is regarding with food.

# About me

First, I talk myself.
I'm kazuaki matsuo and working at Cookpad as test engineer.
I've tried test automation for Android and iOS, and improved development processes and other many role to imprpve quality.
So, "Software Engineer in Quality" might be more suitable name than test engineer, I think.

I use some languages in my work such as swift, ruby, java for android and elixir.
Recently, I've maintained ruby binding client library for Appium.

# A bunch of topics in "TEST"
Even we use the word "TEST", it has various topics.

For example, the word has categories such as usability test and performance test and has test level such as unit test and integration test.
Today, I pick up a test pyramid which has three layers, unit test, integration test and ui test for automated test and manual test.

# test pyramid
This pyramid is one of famous images for test automation.
The pyramid means ideal relationship and amount between unit tests, integration tests and UI tests in development.
Unit tests deal with testing logic in code level and ui tests focus on simulate user behaviours against test target app.

# How UI Tests support our development
Today, you can tast UI tests and its our story.
I'm happy if anyone has motivation to try ui tests after my talk.

Meanwhile, I don't talk topick about unit test level.

# We should know about the test target if we tast tests
(„ÅÑ„Åæ„ÅÑ„Å°...)

We should learn test target if we tast test not only about tools but also strategies.
So, I'll explain about Cookpad and its iOS app at first to help you understand the following topics.

# What is Cookpad?
